# Itty Editor #
Itty Editor is a simple, **JavaScript** and **CSS** driven **WYSIWYG** editor.
## WYSIWYG 2-Way Editor-Converter ##
### between Markdown Text and xHTML ###

Developed for my article repository and directory to make it easy on authors to write, edit, and submit articles in text.

Store the articles in your database in either Markdown text or converted xhtml. Markdown text is simple, intuitive formating, like email text. So writing in Markdown text is super fast and easy.

The toolbar editor is 99% pure JavaScript, 1% CSS. A consolidated JSOP (JavaScript Object Programming) port, it recombines related open source code for xhtml-to-markdown, markdown-to-xhtml, and wysiwyg editing.

Itty Editor is a standout in that:
  * you can convert either direction text to xhtml, or xhtml to text
  * it sports a clean wysiwyg toolbar for easy formatting of text
  * unlimited undo and redo
  * preview the xhtml below the editor, in real time
  * toolbar is rebrandable with your own logo
  * compact CSS design
  * object oriented code, no js libraries or js geniuses required
  * uses only textarea elements, no iframes

Markdown.pl, by John Gruber, has been ported to many platforms.
The author also ports showdown.js, copyright 2007 John Fraser, to JSOP, and recombines it with other open source JavaScript attributed in the source code.

## Two Modes ##
